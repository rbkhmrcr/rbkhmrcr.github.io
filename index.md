## Hello

As of January 2023, I'm a PhD student in the applied cryptography department of 
ETH Zürich, working with [Kenny Paterson](https://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/) and 
[Elli
Androulaki](https://researcher.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=zurich-LLI) and 
Kaoutar Elkhiyaoui at IBM Research 
Zürich! From 2020 - 2022 I was a Privacy Engineer at Apple, and before that I was
a cryptography engineer at Mina, working mostly on getting the necessary
cryptography implemented on the Ledger hardware wallet with its generous 2kB of
stack :) In 2018 I worked with UNICEF Office of Innovation on privacy
preserving machine learning, and before and during that, from 2017 - 2018 I was
a student at Aarhus University, working with [Claudio
Orlandi](http://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/) and [Ivan
Damgård](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~ivan/).
