## Hello

As of January 2023, I'm a PhD student working with IBM Research Zürich.  From
2020 - 2022 I was a Privacy Engineer at Apple, and before that I was
a cryptography engineer at Mina, working mostly on getting the necessary
cryptography implemented on the Ledger hardware wallet with its generous 2kB of
stack :) I also working with UNICEF Office of Innovation on privacy preserving
machine learning. Before that, from 2017 - 2018 I was a student at Aarhus
University, working with [Claudio Orlandi](http://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/) and
[Ivan Damgård](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~ivan/).
